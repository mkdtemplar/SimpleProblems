Sun Tzu was a Chinese military strategist and general best known as the author of the work
The Art of War, a treatise on military strategy also known as The Thirteen Chapters. He was associated
formally or as an inspiration with The School of the Military, one of the philosophical systems of the Hundred
Schools of Thought of the Spring and Autumn Period, which advocated military preparedness in
maintaining peace and social order.
Whether an individual by the name of Sun-Tzu existed at all has been disputed in the same way scholars and historians
debate the existence of his supposed contemporary Lao-Tzu, the Taoist philosopher. The existence of
The Art of War, however, and its profound influence since publication clearly proves that someone existed to produce
said work, and tradition holds that the work was written by one Sun-Tzu.
His historicity would seem to have been confirmed by the discovery in 1972 of his work, as well as that of his
apparent descendant, Sun Bin who wrote another Art of War, in a tomb in Linyi in Shandong province.
Scholars who challenge his historicity, however, still claim that this proves nothing as the earlier Art of War could
still have been composed by someone other than Sun-Tzu.
Sun-Tzu is said to have lived, fought, and composed his work during the Spring and Autumn Period which preceded the
Warring States Period 481-221-BCE during which the Zhou Dynasty was declining and the states once
bound to it fought each other for supremacy and control of China.
